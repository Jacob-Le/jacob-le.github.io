# HW 3 part C 
## Part 1 Topic: Caustics
We could use noise to place points across a plane to create a voronoi diagram.  We can then animate that diagram by moving the placed points.  The plane we draw on will be the blue water background, and the lines along the voronoi diagram will be colored in white.  We can use some sort of signed distance function to get a softer look for each line in the voronoi diagram.
